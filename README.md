● Create an account on GitHub if you do not have one already. Create a new
repository for this application. You may use any other git provider of your choice
as well (Bitbucket, GitLab, etc). Just ensure that your repository is accessible by us
after submission.
● Make sure that you commit frequently. We will not accept the submission if there
is only one commit with the entire code in it. This is used to ensure fairness and
check your coding style. Write proper commit messages.
● Share the link to your GitHub repo after you have completed building the
application.
● Ensure that instructions for running the application and database schema design
link are clearly specified in the README.md file. If we cannot get the application to
run, then it’s your loss.
● [Optional] If possible, host the application using some free online hosting tool
