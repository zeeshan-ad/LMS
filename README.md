DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS
  ● Design the database schema in an online tool like figma, protopie, framer etc. or in
  white paper. Share the link/pictures to the design in the README as mentioned in
  Submission Instructions .
  ● Create a React.js application using libraries of your choice. Refer to the Learning
  section, if you’re not sure what to choose.
  ● Create the routes and write the service logic for calling various API endpoints.
  ● Run some tests to ensure the application works as expected.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
  ● Please use git to version control your progress
  ● Create an account on GitHub if you do not have one already. Create a new
  repository for this application. You may use any other git provider of your choice
  as well (Bitbucket, GitLab, etc). Just ensure that your repository is accessible by us
  after submission.
  ● Make sure that you commit frequently. We will not accept the submission if there
  is only one commit with the entire code in it. This is used to ensure fairness and
  check your coding style. Write proper commit messages.
  ● Share the link to your GitHub repo after you have completed building the
  application.
  ● Ensure that instructions for running the application and database schema design
  link are clearly specified in the README.md file. If we cannot get the application to
  run, then it’s your loss.
  ● [Optional] If possible, host the application using some free online hosting tool
